            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Superannuation in Australia</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What is Superannuation (Super)?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Superannuation, or 'super', is a system in Australia where money is saved for your retirement. Your employer generally has to pay a percentage of your earnings (called the Superannuation Guarantee) into a super fund for you. These savings are invested and grow over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is the Superannuation Guarantee (SG) calculated?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The Superannuation Guarantee (SG) is the minimum amount your employer must pay into your super fund. It's calculated as a percentage of your ordinary time earnings (OTE), up to a maximum contribution base. The rate is set by the Australian government and increases periodically, reaching 12% by 1 July 2025.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why is inflation important for my super forecast?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time. While your nominal super balance might grow significantly, its 'real' value (what it can actually buy) will be less if inflation is high. Our superannuation calculator helps you see both the nominal and inflation-adjusted projected balance, giving you a more realistic view of your future financial power.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I make extra contributions to my super?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can make additional contributions to your superannuation on top of what your employer pays. These can be 'concessional' (before-tax) or 'non-concessional' (after-tax) contributions. Making extra contributions can significantly boost your super balance over the long term due to the power of compounding. Always check current contribution caps.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does this calculator estimate my retirement balance?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our superannuation calculator projects your balance by taking your current super, salary, and additional contributions, then applying an estimated annual investment return over your remaining working years. It also factors in the changing Superannuation Guarantee rate and can adjust for inflation to give you a real-value projection. Note: It's an estimate and not financial advice.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Is this calculator affiliated with AustralianSuper (the super fund)?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">No, AusSuperCalc.com.au is an **independent online tool** designed to help all Australians project their superannuation growth, **regardless of which super fund they are with.** We are not affiliated with AustralianSuper or any other specific superannuation fund. This calculator provides general estimates for anyone in the Australian superannuation system.</p>
